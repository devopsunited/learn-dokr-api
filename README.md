# learn-dokr-api
A little web-api to learn or simply use docker via a browser UI

IN PROGRESS

#### To use it, docker must be user accessible (not root)

```
npm install
```

#### To understand it, run docker in your machine, visit in your browser
```
localhost:3888/cmd/bookmark/ps
```
And note that 'ps' is stored in bookmarks.json
